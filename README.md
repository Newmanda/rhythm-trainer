A rhythmic dictation trainer that encourages chunking

This is currently in a prototype stage. It was slapped together in the last week.
It is not pretty. But it works, and I'm encouraging students to use it.

In the current state of the program, the trainer creates a random series of patterns within a quarter note beat and plays them 
with a two beat count-off. The user then identifies the pattern.

Written in javascript and html5, both to be supremely portable and to work on whatever devices students may own. (especially phones.)

I used Bootstrap for basic CSS and surikov's webaudiofont to handle audio.

I have been learning javascript as I go with this, and have recently gotten some great help cleaning it up, and learning more in
the process. But there are a few more pieces of code to revise to modern standards, and incorporating more flexibility.
